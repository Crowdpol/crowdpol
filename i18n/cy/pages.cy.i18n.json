				"project": {
					"heading": "CY: The project",
					"paragraph-1": "CY: Democracy 2018 is an open project that invites all Swedish citizens to explore the potential of so called liquid democracy and use this platform to select the issues and proposals most important to them. The ten most popular proposals will be presented to the new parliament after the election in September 2018. The purpose is in part to test a modernized version of our democratic system, but also to encourage the population to learn more about the issues this election year as well as find out where the various political parties stand on them. Finally the goal is to inform the members of parliaments and other political elites of how a hopefully representative cross-section of the population feel about various topics, in an effort to create dialogue and trust.",
    				"paragraph-2": "CY: The project opens on January first and concludes on September 15, Global Democracy Day, after which the results will be tallied and presented to the Minister of Democracy."
				},
				"liquid-democracy": {
					"heading": "CY: Liquid Democracy",
					"paragraph-1": "CY: Liquid democracy is a voting system that incorporates the benefit of representative democracy with the benefits of direct democracy, yet avoids the pitfalls of both. The system uses delegation, much like traditional delegation of the individual vote through electing a political party or representative, but with a few modernizing tweaks. Through liquid democracy it is possible not only to delegate to a political party but to any organisation or individual that signs up to the system as a delegate. This means that a party, organisation or individual can have political clout without actually holding political office. It is also quite possible for the voter to select several delegates, not merely a single party, and to unselect or change a delegate at any time. Thus the liquid like feature of the democratic system.",
    				"paragraph-2": "CY: The role of the delegate is to vote on issues on the individuals behalf that he or she does not have time or inclination to delve deeper into, much like the role of the traditional political representative. Unlike the latter the delegate is in effect only an advisor to the individual voter, who must ultimately sign off on each issue. Herein lies the connection to direct democracy. The voter can at any time actively vote on any issue, which will automatically override any vote by a preselected delegate",
    				"paragraph-3": "CY: The benefits are numerous. The system allows for a customized political platform with almost infinite possibilities as voters can potentially write and submit their own proposals to the scrutiny and potential support of their peers. Voters can also change their minds at any point in time if their selected delegates fall short of expectations, adding fluidity to the system. Delegates who do not live up to their promises will soon find they have lost much of their support, a powerful incentive against corruption. The immediacy of direct voting is tempered by the option of using delegation for more complex issues, avoiding the pitfall of uniformed decision making to a far greater degree than pure direct democracy can provide. The system of delegates allows for a far greater range of organisations and individuals to have direct influence over the political scene without having to hold office. Opening up completely new alleys of influence, provided they have sufficient support of the voting public. To name a few."
				},
				"how-it-works": {
					"heading": "CY: How it works",
					"paragraph-1": "CY: In our particular project the voter is first invited to join through a social media account or an email. Once the account is confirmed, the voter is presented with a number of political parties, organisations and individuals that act as delegates. The voter selects the delegates of her or his choice, and is then invited to rank them. A more highly ranked delegate will count before a less high one when the delegates voting preferences are calculated. The voter can however easily see which delegate voted in which way on each issue as all delegated votes are completely open.",
    				"paragraph-2": "CY: Then the voter will be directed to the second step, which is to vote on the issues. The project will start with ten proposals, but will add on average two new proposals per week for the duration of the project. For practical purposes these proposals will be selected by an editorial board. Each proposal will be indicated with a supporting or a rejecting indication, depending on the choices of the selected delegates. The voter will then be invited to confirm the preselected vote, or to vote differently. The voter can change his or her vote, as well as delegates, as any time until the deadline at midnight of 15 September 2018, or the conclusion of this particular project.",
    				"paragraph-3": "CY: Voters who wish to engage more can become members. Members will be able to write their own proposals, comment on each other’s proposals and vote for which proposals the editorial board should submit to the general public next.",
    				"paragraph-4":"CY: Individuals and organisations can also register as delegates. This is free of charge but will require proof of identity, in the form of a national ID for individuals or an email address linked to the organisations official webpage."
