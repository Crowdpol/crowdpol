      <h1>What is Democracy</h1>
      <p>
        Democracy (Greek: δημοκρατία dēmokratía, literally "rule by people") is a<br>
        system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting. In a direct<br>
        democracy, the citisens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on<br>
        each issue. In a representative democracy the citizens elect representatives<br>
        from among themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, we are building an elegant online platform for Global Liquid<br>
        Democracy, a system that combines the virtues of both it's predeccessors but<br>
        none of the drawbacks. Our goal is to give every citizen in every country<br>
        access to a set of digital tools for creating local, national and even global<br>
        democratics development.
